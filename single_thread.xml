HULL, England -- Three quick thoughts on Hull City&amp;apos;s 1-0 win Tuesday night over Liverpool in the Premier League at KC Stadium.



1. Hull&amp;apos;s home comforts



It is at the KC Stadium where Hull City&amp;apos;s future will be decided, though perhaps they may have decided it here -- 34 points may already be enough. Arsenal and Manchester United must visit Humberside, plus Burnley, which City may be able to escape with a draw.


Pre-match adverts for season tickets seemed more in hope than expectation of being...

				<title>Luis Enrique and Ancelotti among Liga managers with uncertain futures</title>

										Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti insists his side&amp;apos;s 3-1 win over Malaga was a positive match, despite Gareth Bale and Luka Modric both limping off with injuries. 
									
								
							

							
			
			
				
				
			
				
					Luis Enrique is chasing three trophies with Barcelona but his Camp Nou future is far from secure.
				
			
		
Even by Spanish standards, it would take a notable degree of short-sightedness from the leading clubs for Atletico Madrid to be the lone team of La Liga&amp;apos;s top five sides to begin next season with their current coach.
There are some identical threads in the stories that weave their way through all five -- Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atletico Madtid, Valencia and Sevilla -- but, equally, there are also idiosyncrasies in each instance.
This golden age for Spanish clubs -- let nobody doubt that we have...

							Brendan Rodgers reacted to Liverpool&amp;apos;s 1-0 defeat at Hull by attributing their troubles this season to a lack of goals after Luis Suarez was sold while Daniel Sturridge has spent most of the season injured.
&amp;quot;We can&amp;apos;t hide away from the fact you&amp;apos;ve lost over 50 goals,&amp;quot; the Liverpool manager said. &amp;quot;Any team who loses that is going to struggle.&amp;quot;
The statistics show the extent of their difficulties as Liverpool have gone from having the most potent forward duo in the Premier League to its least prolific...

										ESPN FC&amp;apos;s Craig Burley believes Jurgen Klopp would be a great replacement for Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool, where he feels Rodgers is only capable of a fifth place finish next season. 
									
								
							

							
No one associated with Liverpool could draw positives from the 1-0 loss at Hull on Tuesday. Not the players, who trudged off the pitch at the end knowing that any lingering hope of playing Champions League football next season had been all but quashed. Not the fans, aghast at a fourth defeat in little over a month. Even manager Brendan Rodgers, usually throbbing with optimism and management burble, failed to offer solace, telling reporters that Liverpool got exactly what they deserved.
Meanwhile,...

There was no Martin Odegaard debut on Wednesday night, but two of Real Madrid&amp;apos;s ready-made Galacticos ensured they kept pace with Barcelona at La Liga&amp;apos;s summit with a 3-0 victory over struggling Almeria at the Santiago Bernabeu.

James Rodriguez struck one of the goals of the season just before halftime to save Madrid&amp;apos;s blushes after a poor first-half showing and Almeria midfielder Mauro Alonso put one into his own net just after the break to kill the game as a contest. Alvaro Arbeloa bagged Madrid&amp;apos;s...

										The ESPN FC crew break down Chelsea&amp;apos;s performance against Leicester City and hail John Terry&amp;apos;s effort as he ties the Premier League lead for most goals by a defender.

Chelsea came from behind to score three goals and seal a hard-fought 3-1 victory over the recently resurgent relegation battlers Leicester City at the King Power Stadium.

The Blues, branded as &amp;quot;boring&amp;quot; by fans of title rivals Arsenal, were at their swashbuckling best in a game that underlined why they have dominated the Premier League from start to finish this season. Passion, determination and know-how, exemplified once again by skipper and match-winner John Terry, won the day for Chelsea.

&amp;quot;It&amp;apos;s [like] a final,&amp;quot; Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola had said before his side&amp;apos;s astonishing semifinal DFB Cup defeat on penalties to rivals Borussia Dortmund.
For BVB, their celebrations after the 2-0 shootout success following a 1-1 draw after extra time mirrored those that usually follow a trophy being won. Dortmund&amp;apos;s central Borsigplatz, the birthplace of Borussia Dortmund and traditional location for the expression of communal ecstasy, was overrun with half-naked black-and-yellow supporters...

					James Rodriguez woke up a stagnant Real Madrid with a stunning strike against Almeria -- his 16th goal of the season.
				
			
		

MADRID, Spain -- Three things from the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu as Real Madrid keep up their La Liga title chase with a routine, uninspiring 3-0 win over Almeria on Wednesday evening.

1. James brightens things up 
Real Madrid eventually won easily, but this was far from a classic. Both sides were sloppy in possession through the opening stages, and there was little goalmouth action to get excited about. Cristiano Ronaldo&amp;apos;s 30-yard free kick which dipped pretty viciously onto the roof of the net...

"Yes, it is true," Pirvulescu told local media. "If the shareholders have doubts, it's very good to investigate." The match under investigation is their 1-0 home defeat by relegation-threatened Universitatea Cluj-Napoca on April 20. Doubts arose among Pandurii shareholders after Pirvulescu allegedly met with Universitatea officials before the game.</description><link>http://sports.yahoo.com/news/soccer-romanian-club-suspend-president-amid-match-fixing-164816378--sow.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2015 12:48:16 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">news/soccer-romanian-club-suspend-president-amid-match-fixing-164816378--sow</guid></item><item><title>Soccer-Levski knock holders Ludogorets out of Bulgarian Cup</title><description>Levski Sofia's Antonio Anete scored a delightful goal in stoppage time to seal a dramatic 1-0 win over holders Ludogorets on Wednesday and send his side into the Bulgarian Cup final for the 36th time. Levski, who have won the competition 25 times, went through 1-0 on aggregate after the semi-final first leg ended goalless.
